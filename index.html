        <p>Anambra, whose motto is the "Light of the Nation," is a state in southeastern Nigeria
            known for its vibrant culture, industrious populace (predominantly Igbo), and strong
            commercial
            significance. Its capital is Awka, while Onitsha serves as a major commercial hub with
            one of the largest
            markets in West Africa, and Nnewi is a rapidly developing industrial city. The state has
            a rich
            history dating back to the 9th century AD, notably the ancient Kingdom of Nri, and
            boasts a high
            literacy rate and significant contributions to Nigerian academia, business, and
            politics. With natural
            resources including crude oil and natural gas, and an economy driven by agriculture,
            trade, and
            industry, Anambra is one of Nigeria's most urbanized and densely populated states.
